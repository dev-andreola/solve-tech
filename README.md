# SolveTech Landing Page

<img src="./public/readme-banner.png" align="center"/>

## Overview

Web design of a landing page for my fictional software development company.

To develop this project I used next.js and styled it in a fully responsive way using tailwind and some components from shancn.ui

Still in the development process...
